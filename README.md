This was originally a group project from Hack Reactor, due to the short timeline it was only a semi-finished product. I since then revamped the project to include more features, redesigned the entire system with a different approach, rewrote the entire code base and built it from scratch. And now it becomes my personal project.

Technologies: Javascript, React, Node.js, MUI, React hooks, Express
